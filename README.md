# Reddit Sentiment Analysis (Data Science Project)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs **exploratory data analysis (EDA) and sentiment evaluation** on Reddit comments using a Kaggle dataset.  
The focus is on **data understanding, text analysis, visualization, and insight generation**, rather than heavy machine learning or deployment.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze sentiment distribution in Reddit comments  
- Study text length and word usage patterns  
- Perform basic NLP preprocessing and TF-IDF vectorization  
- Evaluate sentiment predictions using standard metrics  
- Conduct error and confidence analysis  
- Extract meaningful data science insights  

---

## 📂 Dataset
- **Source:** Kaggle  
- **Size:** ~37,000 Reddit comments  
- **Columns:**
  - `clean_comment` → Preprocessed Reddit comment text  
  - `category` → Sentiment label (0 = Negative, 1 = Positive)

> Note: This is a static dataset. It does not include subreddit, post, time, or engagement metadata.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- NLTK

## 🔍 Project Workflow
1. Data loading and inspection  
2. Data cleaning and label mapping  
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
4. Text length and word frequency analysis  
5. TF-IDF vectorization  
6. Lightweight sentiment classification  
7. Model evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix, F1-score)  
8. Error analysis  
9. Confidence analysis  
10. Insight generation

## 📊 Key Analysis Performed
- Sentiment distribution visualization  
- Average word and character length comparison  
- Frequent word extraction per sentiment  
- Confusion matrix interpretation  
- Manual inspection of misclassified samples  

---

## 📈 Key Insights
- Negative comments tend to be longer than positive comments  
- Short and sarcastic comments are harder to classify  
- Reddit text data is noisy and context-dependent  
- Even simple models can provide useful analytical insights  

---

## ⚠️ Limitations
- Static Kaggle dataset (no live Reddit API)  
- No subreddit-wise or time-based analysis  
- No engagement metrics (upvotes, scores)  
- Sarcasm and neutral sentiment not explicitly handled  

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Integrate Reddit API (PRAW) for live data  
- Perform subreddit-level sentiment analysis  
- Add time-series sentiment trends  
- Include engagement-based sentiment weighting  

---

## 📌 Resume Highlight
> Analyzed 37k+ Reddit comments using NLP and exploratory data analysis techniques to uncover sentiment patterns, text behavior, and classification insights in Python.
